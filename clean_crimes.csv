ARREST,2019-06-18 20:52:00+00:00,"Officers dispatched to a report of a disturbance and possible assault in the area. Officers arrived and reported that      Cambridge Police was on scene and had detained an individual actively screaming and resisting arrest. Officers approached  Cambridge Police and reported that CPD had been responding to a possible assault in progress, when the individual was      observed attempting to flee the immediate area and subsequently detained. While on scene, officers were then approached by three juveniles who wished to report a recent assault committed by the individual. According to the three juveniles, the individual had been observed accosting pedestrians while waving a wooden stake in the air inside of Harvard Yard. When the
three juveniles approached the individual regarding their behavior, the individual grabbed one of the juveniles by their  
head and a physical altercation ensued between all parties. According to the three juveniles, during the altercation, the 
individual repeatedly attempted to strike them with the aforementioned wooden stake. One of the juveniles then attempted  
to contact the police when the individual brandished a folded knife, waved it in the air, and stated ""I got a knife"".     
Shortly thereafter, Cambridge Police arrived on scene and the individual was apprehended after they attempted to flee the 
area. At the conclusion of the incident, the individual was placed under arrest and transported to the Cambridge Police   
Department for booking.

Officers approached  Cambridge Police and reported that CPD had been responding to a possible assault in progress, when the individual was      observed attempting to flee the immediate area and subsequently detained. While on scene, officers were then approached by three juveniles who wished to report a recent assault committed by the individual. According to the three juveniles, the individual had been observed accosting pedestrians while waving a wooden stake in the air inside of Harvard Yard. When the
three juveniles approached the individual regarding their behavior, the individual grabbed one of the juveniles by their  
head and a physical altercation ensued between all parties. According to the three juveniles, during the altercation, the 
individual repeatedly attempted to strike them with the aforementioned wooden stake. One of the juveniles then attempted  
to contact the police when the individual brandished a folded knife, waved it in the air, and stated ""I got a knife"".     
Shortly thereafter, Cambridge Police arrived on scene and the individual was apprehended after they attempted to flee the 
area. At the conclusion of the incident, the individual was placed under arrest and transported to the Cambridge Police

While at the scene, officers reported that the individual began to engage in increasingly erratic behavior and was         subsequently placed in handcuffs by Cambridge Police. Cambridge Police then reported that a witness to the incident        previously observed the individual in custody throw a glass bottle at the victim's backpack which subsequently broke apart upon impact with the ground.
